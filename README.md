# COMM 2216 User Documentation Project - Writing Your First Python Game

This user document is intended to be read by first term BCIT CST students. However, new developers are welcomed to read it if they have little programming and developer platform experience. This guide will assist students in creating a project structure, creating a program in Python, and uploading projects onto a GitHub repository. These concepts are fundamental skills that every developer should know, and this guide serves as an introduction to these concepts.

This user document will guide students with thorough instructions each step of the process. It will teach readers how to practice good programming habits like proper coding etiquette. It will provide readers with reasons why specific actions were taken. This guide will include definitions used by developers such as string or directory. It will also cover common issues that occur during the process of creating and uploading projects onto GitHub.

This user document was created using MkDocs, a Python package that builds static sites using markdown language for the purposes of documentation and deployed using GitHub's deployment service. A team of two hard-working BCIT students used VSCode to write and manage this guide. [A reference](https://samlee77.github.io/Sam-Test/) was used as a guide to help inspire and create this document.

The instructions found in this document has been user-tested thoroughly. Users of varying knowledge in computer science helped test the effectiveness of each instruction.
