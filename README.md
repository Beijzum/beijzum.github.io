# COMM 2216 User Documentation Project - Writing Your First Python Game

This user documentation focuses on guiding new developers, with a focus on first term BCIT CST students, on how to create a project structure, creating a program in Python, and uploading projects onto a GitHub repository. All of these concepts are fundamental skills that every developer should know, and this guide serves as a light introduction to these concepts, with a step by step walkthrough of every part of the process. We outline basic definition frequently used by developers such as string or directory, along with brief explanations on why each step was taken for users that wish to learn more. We also cover commonly encountered issues that occur during the process of creating and uploading features onto GitHub. This documentation was created usingMkDocs, a Python package that builds static sites using markdown language for the purposes of documentation and deployed using GitHub's deployment service. This documentation was also created with the help of another documentation used as guidance as seen [here](https://samlee77.github.io/Sam-Test/). Finally, the instructions of this documentation has been thoroughly user tested multiple times, with users of different levels of knowledge in computer science to verify the effectiveness of each instruction.
