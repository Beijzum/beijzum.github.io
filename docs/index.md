# Introduction

Welcome. This document will help you create a simple Python game on a Windows operating system. It will also help you upload your Python project to GitHub. The goal is to help first-term British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) Computer Systems Technology (CST) students get started on their coding journey. This guide will help you become more comfortable with writing code and using developer platforms.

> ![PythonIcon](./assets/python_icon_small.png) [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level programming language, which means it is easy to read and understand for humans.

> :material-github: [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

## Intended Users

This guide is targeted towards first-term BCIT CST students with little experience in writing code and using developer platforms.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before proceeding:

-   ![PythonIcon](./assets/python_icon_small.png) [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.x.x+
-   :material-github: [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
-   :material-microsoft-windows: A personal computer or laptop with a Windows operating system
-   :material-lightbulb-on: Basic computer navigation knowledge
-   :octicons-terminal-24: Basic command terminal knowledge
-   :fontawesome-brands-chrome: Google Chrome, :fontawesome-brands-edge: Edge, or :simple-firefoxbrowser: Firefox web browsers with the latest updates

## Procedures Overview

The main sections of this document should be read in the order below:

1. :file_folder: [Setting Up Your Project](./Setting%20Up%20Your%20Project.md)
2. :fontawesome-solid-code: [Writing Your First Game](./Writing%20Your%20First%20Game.md)
3. :material-cloud-upload: [Uploading to GitHub](Uploading%20to%20GitHub.md)

> You may navigate through this document using the _table of contents_ on the left side of this document. It may also appear as a hamburger menu in the top left.

> You may also navigate by _clicking_ the next and previous section arrows at the bottom (footer) of this document.

## Typographical Conventions

This document uses the following style for presenting information:

-   When _clicking_ is mentioned, it means left-clicking on your mouse.

-   _Typing_ in commands in regards to the terminal will look like the following:

    ```
    Type these words
    ```

    a. You must press the "enter" or "return" key on your keyboard after typing the command to activate the command.

-   Python code snippets will look like the following:

    ```py
    print("Hello World!")
    ```

    a. You must write Python code in the notepad application.

    b. You must press the "enter" or "return" key after typing in the code found in the code snippet. This creates a new line and prepares you for the next line of code. For example, if you were instructed to _type_ the previously shown code snippet three times, then it should look like the following:

    ```py
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Hello World!")
    ```

-   Directory and file names will look like the following:

    a. Directory names will look like `directory_name`.

    b. File names will look like `filename.extension` with the period designating the file's extension.

-   Terminal commands and Python keywords mentioned outside of code blocks will look like the following:

    a. Python keywords like "print()" will look like `print()`. Variable names like "user_input" will look like `user_input`.

    b. Terminal commands like "git init" will look like `git init`.

## Notes and Warning Messages
